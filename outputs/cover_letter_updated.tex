I am applying for the Software Engineer (Python) – Data Pipelines \& APIs role to support glossAPI (\href{https://glossapi.gr/}{glossapi.gr}). I am an AI/LLM-focused Python engineer who builds production-grade ETL pipelines, small REST services (Flask/FastAPI), and well-documented, reproducible tooling—values that align with EELLAK’s open technology mission and the practices in \href{https://github.com/eellak/glossAPI}{eellak/glossAPI}.

At Kataskevi ATE, I built Python tooling to automate data collection, reporting, and forecasting for planning and resource allocation. This included scheduled jobs on Linux, clean CSV/JSON ingestion, basic schema validation with Pydantic, SQL (SQLite/PostgreSQL) for analysis, and robust logging. The result was faster, reproducible ETL and more reliable decision support.

As a freelancer, I shipped AI-powered applications and data/API utilities end-to-end:
- LangChain RAG Chat: Flask backend + React UI; crawls docs (Tavily), splits/embeds (OpenAI), stores in Pinecone; serves answers via REST with citations and fallback logic.
- readmegen: Flask API that inspects repo files safely, uses LangChain with structured outputs to generate high-quality READMEs; Docker-compose orchestration and optional LangSmith tracing; CI with GitHub Actions.
- Tax AI App: Flask REST API with Swagger docs and a CI pipeline for builds/tests/linting.

These projects mirror your stack and workflows: HTTP/REST integrations, JSON/CSV/YAML handling, CLI/REST utilities, Git/GitHub collaboration with issues/PRs, and clear documentation (I’m comfortable writing READMEs and technical guides in LaTeX). I’m familiar with responsible web data collection (requests/BeautifulSoup), basic Linux/Debian administration and cron, and I work fluently in both Greek and English.

I would be excited to contribute to glossAPI’s pipelines, CLI tools, and documentation, and to collaborate with the EELLAK community on open, well-engineered data infrastructure. I’d welcome the chance to discuss how my Python, RAG/AI, and API experience can help advance your goals. Selected work: \href{https://github.com/Herc-Ch}{github.com/Herc-Ch}.
