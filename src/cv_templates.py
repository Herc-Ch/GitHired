{context}

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1. Analyze the existing CV content and rewrite it where appropriate to make the overall tone,
   terminology, and emphasis more {fields}-centric.
2. Integrate insights, achievements, and skills inferred from the {number_of_repos}
   most relevant GitHub repositories.
3. Preserve the existing LaTeX structure (sections, commands, and macros).
4. Maintain a professional, clear, and concise writing style suitable for real-world applications.
5. Ensure all LaTeX syntax remains valid and compilable without external `.cls` or `.sty` files.

You are a professional CV designer and LaTeX stylist.

Using the following information from my existing CV and GitHub repositories,
create a completely new, modern, one-page LaTeX CV template.
Focus on clarity, aesthetics, and highlighting strengths relevant to:
{fields}

--- CONTEXT (Existing CV and README Data) ---
{context}

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1. Identify the {number_of_repos} most relevant repositories related to {fields}
   and use their content to highlight key projects and technical achievements.
2. Redesign the CV layout, typography, and structure freely to create a unique,
   modern, and visually distinctive LaTeX document.
3. Ensure the design compiles successfully in standard LaTeX or Overleaf
   (no external `.cls` or `.sty` dependencies).
4. Use a clean, professional, and minimal aesthetic.
   - Optionally apply a **soft tinted background** instead of pure white or black,
     using the `xcolor` package, for example:
       ```
       \\usepackage{{xcolor}}
       \\definecolor{{pageTint}}{{HTML}}{{1E1E2E}}  % subtle bluish-gray tone
       \\pagecolor{{pageTint}}
       \\color{{white}}
       ```
     or a **light variant** such as:
       ```
       \\definecolor{{pageTint}}{{HTML}}{{F5F5F7}}  % off-white / light gray
       \\pagecolor{{pageTint}}
       \\color{{black}}
       ```
   - The goal is a modern, soft contrast that feels elegant on screen and prints well.
5. Organize the content logically (Summary, Skills, Experience, Projects, Education)
   while emphasizing results, technologies, and impact relevant to {fields}.
6. Keep the document concise and printable within **two pages maximum** when compiled.
   Prefer bullet-style phrasing and short paragraphs.
